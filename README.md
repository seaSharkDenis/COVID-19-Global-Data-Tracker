# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker

## Project Description:

In this project, learners will build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.  

By the end, they’ll have a data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.
